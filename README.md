Convert **Pro Cycling Manager CDB** database files to and from SQLite, straight from the command line or your own code. Lightweight, isomorphic (Node.js **and** the browser), and zero-configuration.

The conversion is **lossless**: a full `cdb → sqlite → cdb` round-trip preserves every table, column, data type, and flag — so you can edit a save in any SQLite tool and load it back into the game. Optionally, it can reconstruct the save's relationships as real `PRIMARY KEY` / `FOREIGN KEY` constraints, turning the export into a normalized database you can explore with JOINs and ER-diagram tools.

## Features

- **CDB ↔ SQLite** — convert between the binary CDB format and standard SQLite databases.
- **CLI included** — convert files without writing any code; direction is auto-detected.
- **Lossless round-trip** — table flags, column order, and data types survive an export/reopen cycle.
- **Optional relational schema** — reconstruct `PRIMARY KEY` / `FOREIGN KEY` constraints for JOINs and ER diagrams, without breaking the round-trip.
- **Node-first, browser-capable** — the CLI and default `better-sqlite3` engine target Node.js; an optional `sql.js` (WASM) engine covers the browser.
- **Lightweight** — the library's own code is ~28 kB, with only `pako` as a hard dependency. SQLite engines (`better-sqlite3`, `sql.js`) are optional and installed separately.
- **TypeScript-first** — native type definitions and full IDE support.
- **Tree-shakeable** — pure functions, no side effects, ESM + CommonJS builds.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install cdb-converter
```

> [!NOTE]
> Requires **Node.js 22 or newer**. The CLI and the default `better-sqlite3` engine need `better-sqlite3` (a native dependency); install it alongside `cdb-converter`. For the browser, install `sql.js` instead — it loads its WebAssembly runtime on demand.

The fastest way to try it is the CLI:

```bash
npx cdb-converter save.cdb
```

## Command line

The package ships a `cdb-converter` command. The conversion direction is auto-detected from the input file extension.

```bash
# CDB → SQLite (default output: save.sqlite)
npx cdb-converter save.cdb

# SQLite → CDB (default output: save.cdb)
npx cdb-converter save.sqlite

# Provide an explicit output path (directories are created as needed)
npx cdb-converter save.cdb data/save.sqlite

# Reconstruct PRIMARY KEY / FOREIGN KEY constraints (CDB → SQLite only)
npx cdb-converter save.cdb save.sqlite --normalize

# Help / version
npx cdb-converter --help
npx cdb-converter --version
```

| Input extension   | Direction    | Default output   |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| `.cdb`            | CDB → SQLite | `<input>.sqlite` |
| `.sqlite` / `.db` | SQLite → CDB | `<input>.cdb`    |

| Option              | Effect                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-n`, `--normalize` | (CDB → SQLite only) reconstruct PK/FK constraints from PCM naming conventions. See [Normalized schema](#normalized-schema). |
| `--index-fk`        | Implies `--normalize`; also indexes every FK column for faster JOINs (roughly doubles output size).                         |

## Library usage

### CDB to SQLite

```typescript
import fs from "node:fs";
import { betterSqlite3Engine } from "cdb-converter/engines/better-sqlite3";
import { cdbToSql } from "cdb-converter";

// Read and convert a CDB file
const cdbBuffer = fs.readFileSync("save.cdb");
const db = cdbToSql(cdbBuffer, betterSqlite3Engine);

// Query it like any SQLite database
const result = db.exec("SELECT * FROM Teams LIMIT 5");
console.log(result[0].values);

// Export to a .sqlite file
fs.writeFileSync("save.sqlite", db.export());
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must pass a `SqlEngine`. `cdb-converter/engines/better-sqlite3` (requires the `better-sqlite3` package) is the default for Node.js; `cdb-converter/engines/sql-js` (requires the `sql.js` package) works in the browser but needs an `await` to initialize its WASM runtime. See [Using a different SQLite engine](#using-a-different-sqlite-engine).

### Normalized schema

By default the SQLite output is a flat mirror of the CDB tables, with no relational constraints. Pass `{ normalize: true }` to reconstruct `PRIMARY KEY` and `FOREIGN KEY` constraints from the PCM naming conventions (`ID{table}` identity columns and `fkID{target}` references), turning the export into a proper relational database — ready for JOINs, entity-relationship diagrams, and schema introspection tools.

```typescript
const db = cdbToSql(cdbBuffer, betterSqlite3Engine, { normalize: true });

// Relationships are now navigable:
db.exec(`
  SELECT c.gene_sz_name, t.gene_sz_name
  FROM DYN_cyclist c
  JOIN DYN_team t ON c.fkIDteam = t.IDteam
`);
```

Notes:

- **Round-trip safe.** Constraints are declarative metadata only; `sqlToCdb` ignores them, so a normalized database still converts back to a byte-identical CDB. The flag is only meaningful in the CDB → SQLite direction.
- **Foreign keys are not enforced.** `PRAGMA foreign_keys` is left OFF so orphaned references (common in real saves) never block the conversion.
- **Best-effort.** Columns whose relationship cannot be inferred simply get no constraint. Primary keys are downgraded to a plain index when the data is not unique.
- **Foreign-key indexes are opt-in.** Pass `{ normalize: true, indexForeignKeys: true }` to also index every FK column for faster JOINs. These indexes roughly double the output size and conversion time, so `normalize` alone leaves them out — the schema is fully relational either way.

```typescript
// Lean: constraints only (~+40% size)
cdbToSql(cdbBuffer, betterSqlite3Engine, { normalize: true });

// Heavier, faster JOINs: also index FK columns (~2x size)
cdbToSql(cdbBuffer, betterSqlite3Engine, { normalize: true, indexForeignKeys: true });
```

### SQLite to CDB

```typescript
import fs from "node:fs";
import { betterSqlite3Engine } from "cdb-converter/engines/better-sqlite3";
import { sqlToCdb } from "cdb-converter";

// Load a SQLite database and convert back to CDB
const sqliteBuffer = fs.readFileSync("save.sqlite");
const db = new betterSqlite3Engine.Database(sqliteBuffer);

const cdbBuffer = sqlToCdb(db); // automatically compressed
fs.writeFileSync("save.cdb", Buffer.from(cdbBuffer));
```

### Compression

The library handles CDB compression (zlib deflate) transparently, but the helpers are exposed if you need them directly:

```typescript
import { compressCdb, decompressCdb } from "cdb-converter";

const compressed = compressCdb(cdbData);
const decompressed = decompressCdb(compressed); // accepts compressed or raw input
```

### Browser

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sql.js@1.14.1/dist/sql-wasm.js"></script>
<script type="module">
  import { cdbToSql } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cdb-converter/+esm";
  import { createSqlJsEngine } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cdb-converter/+esm/engines/sql-js";

  const SQL = await createSqlJsEngine({
    locateFile: (file) =>
      `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/sql.js@1.14.1/dist/${file}`,
  });

  // Read a CDB from a file input
  const file = document.getElementById("cdb-input").files[0];
  const cdbBuffer = await file.arrayBuffer();

  const db = cdbToSql(cdbBuffer, SQL);
  console.log(db.exec("SELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'"));
</script>
```

## API reference

### `cdbToSql(cdbBuffer, SQL, options?): SqlDatabase`

Convert CDB binary data into a SQLite database instance.

- **`cdbBuffer`** — `ArrayBuffer | Uint8Array`, raw CDB data (compressed or uncompressed).
- **`SQL`** — a `SqlEngine`. Use `betterSqlite3Engine` from `cdb-converter/engines/better-sqlite3` (Node.js) or `createSqlJsEngine()` from `cdb-converter/engines/sql-js` (browser). See [Using a different SQLite engine](#using-a-different-sqlite-engine).
- **`options.normalize`** — `boolean` (default `false`). Reconstruct PK/FK constraints from PCM naming conventions. See [Normalized schema](#normalized-schema).
- **`options.indexForeignKeys`** — `boolean` (default `false`). When normalizing, also index every FK column for faster JOINs (roughly doubles the output size).
- **returns** — a `SqlDatabase` with the CDB tables loaded.

### `sqlToCdb(db): ArrayBuffer`

Convert a SQLite database back to CDB binary format (automatically compressed).

- **`db`** — a `SqlDatabase` instance.
- **returns** — compressed CDB binary data as an `ArrayBuffer`.

### Using a different SQLite engine

The library's public API isn't tied to any single SQLite implementation — it's typed against the minimal, self-contained `SqlEngine`/`SqlDatabase` interfaces exported from the package root, so any object matching that shape works. Two engines ship with the package as optional subpaths (their underlying SQLite package must be installed separately, so consumers who don't need one don't pay for it):

- **`cdb-converter/engines/better-sqlite3`** — exports `betterSqlite3Engine`. The default for Node.js and what the CLI uses; requires `npm install better-sqlite3` (a native dependency).
- **`cdb-converter/engines/sql-js`** — exports `createSqlJsEngine()` (async). The only option that runs in the browser; requires `npm install sql.js`.

Other engines can be wired up with a hand-written adapter matching `SqlEngine`/`SqlDatabase`:

- [Node.js — swapping the SQLite engine](./samples/node-sqlite-engine/) — a sample adapter for Node's built-in [`node:sqlite`](https://nodejs.org/api/sqlite.html), not shipped yet since its API is still experimental.

### `compressCdb(data): ArrayBuffer`

Compress CDB data using zlib deflate. Accepts `ArrayBuffer | Uint8Array`.

### `decompressCdb(data): ArrayBuffer`

Decompress CDB data, transparently handling both compressed and already-uncompressed input.

> Lower-level building blocks (`CDBReader`, `CDBWriter`), enums (`ChunkType`, `DataType`, `Magic`), and all TypeScript types are also exported from the package root.

## Supported data types

Every CDB data type is preserved during conversion:

| Type            | Description       | Example          |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| `INTEGER`       | 32-bit signed     | `42`             |
| `FLOAT`         | IEEE 754 float32  | `3.14`           |
| `STRING`        | UTF-8 text        | `"cyclist"`      |
| `BOOLEAN`       | Bit-packed        | `true` / `false` |
| `INTEGER_BYTE`  | 8-bit signed      | `-128` to `127`  |
| `INTEGER_SHORT` | 16-bit unsigned   | `0` to `65535`   |
| `FLOAT_LIST`    | Array of floats   | `(1.5,2.3,3.7)`  |
| `INTEGER_LIST`  | Array of integers | `(10,20,30)`     |

## How metadata is preserved

The library uses a special `DB_STRUCTURE` table to round-trip CDB metadata that has no native SQLite equivalent:

```sql
CREATE TABLE DB_STRUCTURE (
  TableName TEXT '274',
  ID INTEGER,
  Flags INTEGER
)
```

Each table's flags (their exact meaning is unknown but must be preserved) are stored in the `Flags` column, so they are written into the `.sqlite` file itself and survive an `export()`/reopen cycle. Column indices and data types are encoded into each column's declared type annotation. Together this makes `cdb → sqlite → cdb` lossless even when the SQLite database is saved to disk and reopened in a separate process.

## Compatibility

The CDB parser is **format-driven, not version-specific**, so it is not tied to a single Pro Cycling Manager release. Lossless round-trip conversion (`cdb → sqlite → cdb`) is tested against the official databases of:

| Version                  | Status    |
| ------------------------ | --------- |
| Pro Cycling Manager 2014 | ✅ tested |
| Pro Cycling Manager 2018 | ✅ tested |
| Pro Cycling Manager 2019 | ✅ tested |
| Pro Cycling Manager 2021 | ✅ tested |
| Pro Cycling Manager 2025 | ✅ tested |

## Performance & size

A full `cdb → sqlite → cdb` round-trip on a real ~60k-row database stays well under half a second, and the library's own code adds only **~28 kB** — the SQLite WASM runtime is the real weight, and you would pay for it with any SQLite-in-JS approach.

Normalization is opt-in and costs only what you ask for (measured against the default conversion, ~60k rows):

| Mode                             | Conversion time | Output size |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| Default (flat)                   | baseline        | baseline    |
| `normalize`                      | +~10%           | +~40%       |
| `normalize` + `indexForeignKeys` | +~40%           | +~130%      |

See **[bench/README.md](bench/README.md)** for the full per-fixture numbers, the bundle breakdown, and how to reproduce them (`npm run bench`).
